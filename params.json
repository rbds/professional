{"name":"Randy Schur's Project Site","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to my GitHub Page.\r\nI am a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at George Washington University. My focus is in robotics, controls, and mechatronics. On this page you'll find a sample of the work I have done, including classwork, research, and personal projects. \r\n\r\n[Resume](https://github.com/rbds/professional/blob/master/schur_resume_public.pdf)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Research\r\nIn the spirit of Thing Explainer (https://xkcd.com/1133/ uses the one thousand most common words in English to explain complex mechanisms, machines, and ideas): I help tell machines how to get from place to place without running into anything and without running out of power.\r\n\r\nMy research is in energy-focused navigation algorithms for mobile robots. Much of the work takes place in MATLAB simulations, for which you can find the code here: `https://github.com/rbds/Research`. We also have a robotic test platform which uses an Arduino for control and a Raspberry Pi for computing to test out our algorithms in real environments. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\nThis section is a work in progress. \r\n\r\n### Numerical Methods\r\nThis work was completed as a part of the [Numerical Methods](https://github.com/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc) class at GWU. For my [final project](https://github.com/rbds/assignment-bank-2015), I investigated different how numerical integration techniques can be applied to analyzing the motion of physical systems. Using single and double pendulums, I looked at how deriving the equations of motion from the Hamiltonian and the Lagrangian, and the respective methods of integrations, can affect the behavior of a simulated system. If you are interested in numerical integration, symplectic integrators, or mechanics, please [take a look](https://github.com/rbds/assignment-bank-2015)!\r\n\r\n### Undergraduate Senior Design Project\r\nFor a quick summary of the project, here is a link to our video on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHkRwWNwY5s&feature=c4-overview&list=UU7YRCjiy6ZSU-L9T8-2qzhA).\r\n\r\n![Senior Design project poster](https://github.com/rbds/professional/blob/master/senior_design_poster.png)\r\n\r\nMore information about the project can be found on \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
