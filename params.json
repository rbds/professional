{"name":"Randy Schur's Project Site","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to my GitHub Page.\r\nI am a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at George Washington University. My focus is in robotics, controls, and mechatronics. On this page you'll find a sample of the work I have done, including classwork, research, and personal projects. \r\n\r\n[Resume](https://github.com/rbds/professional/blob/master/Schur_Resume.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Research\r\nIn the spirit of Thing Explainer (https://xkcd.com/1133/ uses the one thousand most common words in English to explain complex mechanisms, machines, and ideas): I help tell machines how to get from place to place without running into anything and without running out of power.\r\n\r\nMy research is in energy-focused navigation algorithms for mobile robots. Much of the work takes place in MATLAB simulations, for which you can find the code here: `https://github.com/rbds/Research`. We also have a robotic test platform which uses an Arduino for control and a Raspberry Pi for computing to test out our algorithms in real environments. \r\n\r\n### Projects\r\nThis section is a work in progress. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
